# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love technology and specifically networking technologies. 
Since my early exposure to computing and technology I've always been drawn to how things connect together.

I was really bitten by the IT bug in my freshman year at college.
I found that I was often helping Computer Science students with their own computers and constantly upgrading my own PC.
I also found a group of friends that were into LAN gaming. When not studying, playing games, sleeping in that order I found myself learning as much as possible about networks, computers, operating systems, etc.

**This self taught knowledge helped me with everything from fun project to consulting gig to landing my first jobs in IT.**

- Unstable windows computer hosting LAN gaming server

    --> learn Linux/GNU and host the game server over there

- Subpar network performance between dorms and buddies playing games

    --> building a wireless bridge between dorms and Cat5 LAN

- Campus Windows NT4 DHCP/DNS server crash on a Friday evening

    --> spin up a BIND DNS and DHCP server serving out addresses because campus IT couldn't be bothered off hours
